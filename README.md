# Video Topic Annotation Tool

This project is designed to automatically generate annotations from videos, identifying and separating different topics of discussion using contextual information from the video and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques.

The goal of this tool is to assist in indexing and segmenting long educational videos, helping students easily locate specific topics and navigate through content more efficiently. By providing exact timestamps of when topics are discussed, this tool promotes faster learning and improves overall accessibility to key information.

## Features

- **Automatic Topic Segmentation:** The tool analyzes the video to detect changes in discussion topics using both video context and OCR.
- **Precise Timestamps:** Provides exact timestamps for when each topic is introduced or discussed, making it easier to find relevant information.
- **OCR Integration:** Extracts text data from video slides or subtitles to support topic identification.
- **Optimized for Educational Content:** Tailored specifically for long educational lectures to improve the learning experience.

## Benefits

- **Faster Learning:** Quickly find and review key topics in long educational videos without needing to manually search through hours of content.
- **Enhanced Lookup:** Easily search for specific parts of a lecture by topic, using automated annotations and timestamps.
- **Accessibility:** Breaks down long lectures into digestible segments, improving access to critical information.
